# collage-gen

A project designed for my collage class,
exploring links on the internet.

This really only runs locally/on computers
with selenium.

You can enter a starting website,
and then the program will randomly (within a certain deepness of links)
click a link on that page.

It continues doing this, taking a screenshot each time.

At the end, it generates a collage from the screenshots.

This was partly inspired by
